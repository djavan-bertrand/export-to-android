# Android Assets for Photoshop


A Photoshop script for exporting assets for Android projects.

The script works by duplicating the selected layer (or layergroup) to a new document, then scaling it to each of the 5 common Android sizes (XXXHDPI, XXHDPI, XHDPI, HDPI and MDPI) and then putting the files inside density related folders.

You can specify some parameters for the generated files:

* the name of the generated files.
* the width/heigth of the mdpi generated file (other sizes will be related to this base size).
* the generated file type (jpg or png).
* the root folder where to store all density related folders (if no path is specified, resources will be saved in the same folder as your original resource).
